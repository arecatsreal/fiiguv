Are you ever typing in a text field that is not vim? Don't! Just like don't do it.

### How to user
In your wm/de make a binding to launch fiiguv then when you go to type some where launch fiiguv then when your done press Crl+V or whatever key binding is used to paste and your off to the races. You can also edit text by selecting it then running fiiguv. 

### Dependencies 
+ mktemp
+ xsel
+ xclip

### Other editors
fiiguv just uses the EDITOR variable so whatever terminal editor you have bound there will also work.
